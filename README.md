This site is going to be for my driving school. I'm building this static site because I fed up with malware getting into my site by the means of the wp database or plugins. And it's now costing me a small fortune to keep it clean. So in about six months time I whant my site on github to be up and running under my already existing RijschoolThomas.com domain.
